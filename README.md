In today's competitive e-commerce landscape, showcasing positive customer feedback is crucial for success. Customers are more likely to make a purchase if they see that other shoppers have had positive experiences. Displaying an overall store rating helps to create an immediate impression of trustworthiness and reliability.

The WooCommerce Store Rating extension enables you to display store ratings anywhere on your website using a shortcode. The store rating is derived from the aggregate ratings of your entire product catalog. You can choose from four different layouts to display aggregate store ratings on your website.
